Q1 - What is logistic regression? Or State an example when you have used logistic regression recently.

ANS - Logistic Regression is the preferred model as it is the best technique to predict the outcome from a linear combination. For e.g., if you want to predict if a person will lead the election or not, then to use the binary prediction with the outcome as 0 or 1 that is won/lose. The predictor variables are the amount of money that is spent for the election of the specific candidate and the time spent in conducting the campaign, etc.

Q2 - What do you understand by the term Normal Distribution?

ANS - When the data is distributed in different ways with a bias to either the left side or to the right side or it can be both. The chances are that the data is distributed around a centric value which is not biased to the left or right and has a normal distribution which is in the shape of a curved bell. The variables are randomly distributed to form a symmetric bell curve.

Q3 - What does P-value signify about the statistical data?

ANS - P-value actually determines the significance of the results after the hypothesis test in statistics. It helps in drawing a conclusion between the values of 0 and 1. If the value is more than 0.05, then the evidence is weak and the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. If the value is less than and equal to 0.05, then the evidence is weak and the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and if the value is equal to 0.05 then the value can be denoted either way.

Q4 - What is the difference between Supervised Learning an Unsupervised Learning?

ANS - Supervised Learning refers to when an algorithm learns something from the training data so that knowledge can be applied to test the data. An example is a Classification.

Unsupervised Learning refers to when an algorithm does not learn anything from beforehand as there is no training data. Clustering is an example to this.

Q5 - What do you understand by the job description of a data scientist?

ANS - A data scientist must know how to use the statistical methods. It includes predicting responses, modeling and also using techniques that can meet the needs of the clients. They should know how to develop and also install the statistical tools which will help in building the predictive models. Should know how to analyze the objects and how to approach it. They should have the knowledge to utilize SAS and Excel.

Q6 - What tools or devices help you succeed in your role as a data scientist?

ANS - This question's purpose is to learn the important programming languages and the tools that the person knows and has experience in. Having an experience in SAS and R programming is important, Understanding the use of Python, JAVA and also experience in knowing how to use the data visualization tools.
