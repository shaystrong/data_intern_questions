# Questions

## Please use code, psuedo-code, and/or text to answer the following questions. You will be evaluated based on the quality of your response. There is not necessarily a wrong answer/approach.

1. I have data captured by a 'camera trap'. This is a camera left in the wild at ground level that is triggered by motion in the hopes of collecting candid images of wildlife. This camera has been running for a week, and has collected about 15,000 images (day & night). I want to sort them by animal species efficiently. I also want to use this technique again for future sets of observations. Describe how you would approach this and what tools you would use.

    a) Sometimes humans show up in the images while they are checking the camera during the day. How can we remove these 'bad' data?

    b) What other types of false positives could occur?

2. For the data in the table, use code or psuedo-code of your choice to rank the animal image counts in descending order.

    a) What is apparent in this data set?

    b) What things could be done to this data set to make the distribution of animals more balanced?

```
animal,image_count,day_or_night
crow, 436,day
squirrel,2301,day
deer, 4567,both
wren, 521,day
robin, 123,day
skunk, 1903,night
rabbit, 5698,both
opossum, 335,night
warbler, 3, day

```
