# Questions

## Please use code, psuedo-code, and/or text to answer the following questions. You will be evaluated based on the quality of your response. There is not necessarily a wrong answer/approach.

1. I am asked to develop a model that can detect the impact that a hurricane had on a neighborhood. I can use satellite imagery and/or aerial imagery to make this assessment. I may also want to reuse this model for other hurricanes that happen in the future.  

    a) What imagery type(s) would you select & why? 
    
    b) Describe how you would approach this and what tools you would use. What type of model would you create? 
    
    c) Once you select the data source, how would you go about organizing the data for processing?
    
2. For the data in the table below, there are 3 locations. The 'damage_classification_rank' is the score from 1 to 5 of damage (1 being no damage, 5 being very damaged). Write a script in python to read in the data and determine which location had the most damage. What does that reveal about the data? What are limitations in this data set? 
 
    a) Generate a plot or graphic showing the distribution of damage.


```
id,location,damage_classification_rank
1,Miami, 5
2,Houston,5
3,Miami, 4
4,Rockport, 4
5,Rockport, 5
6,Houston, 3
7,Houston, 3
8,Miami, 2
9,Houston, 3
10,Rockport, 4
11,Rockport, 4
12,Houston, 3
13,Houston, 3
14,Rockport, 1
15,Rockport, 5
16,Miami, 2
17,Rockport, 4
18,Rockport, 3
19,Rockport, 1
20,Rockport, 5
21,Houston,5
